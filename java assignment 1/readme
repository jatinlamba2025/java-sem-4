Program Description- Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args, Scanner, Buffered Reader, DataInputStream, Console)
Part 2:  Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (mean calculation: program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string “end”. It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)
